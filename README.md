# Computer-Vision-Project
Implementation of an anti-spoofing algorithm for facial recognition, designed to detect liveliness in video frames and distinguish between live and spoofed faces. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and incorporates advanced feature extraction techniques to enhance detection accuracy.
